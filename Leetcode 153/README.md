This solution finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using a modified binary search. Here’s a detailed explanation with an example, tracing each step, and including time and space complexity analysis.

Problem Overview

Given a rotated sorted array, like [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], the goal is to find the minimum element in the array. A rotated sorted array is a sorted array that has been “rotated” at some pivot point.

Solution Explanation

The algorithm uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum element. The main idea is to check if the current subarray (from index l to r) is already sorted. If it is, the leftmost element in this subarray is the minimum. Otherwise, it narrows down the search space by moving the l and r pointers.

Step-by-Step Trace

Let’s walk through an example array nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2].

	1.	Initialize Variables:
	•	res = nums[0] = 4 (initially set res to the first element).
	•	l = 0 (left pointer at the beginning of the array).
	•	r = len(nums) - 1 = 6 (right pointer at the end of the array).
	2.	First Iteration:
	•	Check if the current subarray nums[l] to nums[r] is sorted:
	•	Since nums[l] = 4 and nums[r] = 2, nums[l] is greater than nums[r], so this subarray is not sorted.
	•	Calculate the middle index m = (l + r) // 2 = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3.
	•	Update res = min(res, nums[m]) = min(4, 7) = 4.
	•	Since nums[m] = 7 is greater than nums[l] = 4, it means the left half is sorted, so the minimum must be in the right half.
	•	Move the left pointer to l = m + 1 = 4.
	3.	Second Iteration:
	•	Now l = 4 and r = 6.
	•	Check if the subarray nums[l] to nums[r] is sorted:
	•	Since nums[l] = 0 and nums[r] = 2, nums[l] < nums[r], so this subarray is sorted.
	•	Update res = min(res, nums[l]) = min(4, 0) = 0.
	•	Break out of the loop, as we’ve found the minimum in the sorted subarray.
	4.	Return the Result:
	•	The algorithm returns res = 0, which is the minimum element in the array.


Time Complexity

	•	The algorithm uses binary search to divide the array in half with each iteration, making the time complexity O(log n).
	•	This is efficient, as each step discards half of the remaining elements.

Space Complexity

	•	The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space (res, l, r, and m), so the space complexity is O(1).

Summary

The algorithm finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array by checking if subarrays are sorted and adjusting pointers accordingly, using binary search to minimize the number of comparisons. This approach leverages the sorted nature of the array for efficiency.
